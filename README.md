# hello-world
First GitHub adventure
New to Github and trying to find my way around. Hoping for great things.
This is my first branch and going ...
I have only added the new project and this message so far.

I started off a maths/physics major, then phd physics. Completed microsoft certifications, had a stint at eyrytel and oxfarm. Then 3 years at fimat. Finally here in cm 2005. Physics until 2010 moved to engineering. 2015 HE 2 years. Back to Sc as vd/research. Then back to Engineering in 2018 as vd.

Obtained PMP 2019 but embarked on development in early 2020. That is why I am here.
